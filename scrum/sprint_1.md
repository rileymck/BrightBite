# Sprint Retrospective  
**Date/Time:** 3/1/2025 - 11:30 AM  
**Participants:** Whitney, Elicia, Shukria, Zaid, Riley, Yun  

### What Went Well:
- Team members successfully picked up Flutter and Dart quickly.  
- Clear communication and consistent daily scrum participation.  
- Strong collaboration between design and development roles.  
- Figma design and app development were well-aligned.

### What Could Be Improved:
- More effective task distribution and delegation early on.  
- Time management, especially for research-heavy tasks.  
- Clearer definition of overlapping features like the favorites system.

### Action Items:
- Start next sprint with more granular task assignments to avoid overlap.  
- Dedicate one session to resolving implementation conflicts (e.g. favorites system).  
- Allocate time for pair programming or knowledge sharing (especially for backend/database tasks). 
- Set mid-sprint check-ins to realign and assess blockers.
